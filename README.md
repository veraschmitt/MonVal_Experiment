# MonVal_Experiment

The experiment was divided into four smaller experiments due to time constraints. Running the study by asking for all the different influencing factors would have increased the length of the study drastically. 
**Experiment 1 (N=100):** examines WTP and WTA more extensively in relation to privacy concern  

Experiment 2 (N=100): examines WTP and WTA in relation to privacy literacy (OPLIS scale) 
### Experiment 3 (N=100): 
examines WTP and WTA in relation to privacy behaviour
### Experiment 4 Control (N=100): 
examines WTP and WTA in relation to privacy awareness by including privacy nudges with plain information 
### Experiment 4 Experimental (N=100): 
examines WTP and WTA in relation to privacy awareness by including privacy nudges designd based on the traffic light metaphor by showing information of a comprehensive permission reuqest analysis of several applications 




# Ethical Considerations
The experiment was carefully designed not to infringe on the privacy of participants. A unique personal identifier was created at the beginning of the experiment, which only the participants themselves could recreate. 
Thus, only anonymized information about the participants was considered throughout the whole experimental design, which does not allow for identifying individual participants. The experiment was approved by the ethics committee of Faculty IV from the Technische Universit√§t Berlin with no further objections or obligations to consider.
